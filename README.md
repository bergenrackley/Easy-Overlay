# Easy Overlay

A simple Overlay Application I created to make seeing the map in LoL a bit easier. Summon the control panel by pressing Shift + Esc.

Click Define Bounding Box to draw a box around the are to be projected to the middle of the sceen, and click Display Overlay to visualize the overlay. Press Shift+Esc to dismiss the overlay.

In the monitor scale field, enter the UI scale of your monitor, the app has issues calculating the correct pixel positions otherwise.

Opacity controls the opacity of the overlay. By default it's around 20%.

There are some visual bugs if you have HDR turned on. The video stream is also fairly low FPS for some reason, but it's good enough and I can't be bothered to fix it right now.
